        `code` may contain multiple lines of code and may be divided into
        multiple cells in the test data. In that case, the parts are
        catenated together without adding spaces.

        If `code` is an absolute path to an existing file, the JavaScript
        to execute will be read from that file. Forward slashes work as
        a path separator on all operating systems.

        The JavaScript executes in the context of the currently selected
        frame or window as the body of an anonymous function. Use _window_ to
        refer to the window of your application and _document_ to refer to the
        document object of the current frame or window, e.g.
        _document.getElementById('foo')_.

        This keyword returns None unless there is a return statement in the
        JavaScript. Return values are converted to the appropriate type in
        Python, including WebElements.
