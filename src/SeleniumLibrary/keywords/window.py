    def select_window(self, locator='MAIN'):
        """Selects browser window matching ``locator``.

        If the window is found, all subsequent commands use the selected
        window, until this keyword is used again. If the window is not
        found, this keyword fails. The previous window handle is returned,
        and can be used to return back to it later.

        Notice that in this context _window_ means a pop-up window opened
        when doing something on an existing window. It is not possible to
        select windows opened with `Open Browser`, `Switch Browser` must
        be used instead. Notice also that alerts should be handled with
        `Handle Alert` or other alert related keywords.

        The ``locator`` can be specified using different strategies somewhat
        similarly as when `locating elements` on pages.

        - By default the ``locator`` is matched against window handle, name,
          title, and URL. Matching is done in that order and the the first
          matching window is selected.

        - The ``locator`` can specify an explicit strategy by using format
          ``strategy:value`` (recommended) or ``strategy=value``. Supported
          strategies are ``name``, ``title`` and ``url``, which match windows
          using name, title, and URL, respectively. Additionally, ``default``
          can be used to explicitly use the default strategy explained above.

        - If the ``locator`` is ``NEW`` (case-insensitive), the latest
          opened window is selected. It is an error if this is the same
          as the current window.

        - If the ``locator`` is ``MAIN`` (default, case-insensitive),
          the main window is selected.

        - If the ``locator`` is ``CURRENT`` (case-insensitive), nothing is
          done. This effectively just returns the current window handle.

        - If the ``locator`` is not a string, it is expected to be a list
          of window handles _to exclude_. Such a list of excluded windows
          can be get from `Get Window Handles` prior to doing an action that
          opens a new window.

        Example:
        | `Click Link`      | popup1      |      | # Open new window |
        | `Select Window`   | example     |      | # Select window using default strategy |
        | `Title Should Be` | Pop-up 1    |      |
        | `Click Button`    | popup2      |      | # Open another window |
        | ${handle} = | `Select Window`   | NEW  | # Select latest opened window |
        | `Title Should Be` | Pop-up 2    |      |
        | `Select Window`   | ${handle}   |      | # Select window using handle |
        | `Title Should Be` | Pop-up 1    |      |
        | `Select Window`   | MAIN        |      | # Select the main window |
        | `Title Should Be` | Main        |      |
        | ${excludes} = | `Get Window Handles` | | # Get list of current windows |
        | `Click Link`      | popup3      |      | # Open one more window |
        | `Select Window`   | ${excludes} |      | # Select window using excludes |
        | `Title Should Be` | Pop-up 3    |      |

        *NOTE:*

        - The ``strategy:value`` syntax is only supported by SeleniumLibrary
          3.0 and newer.
        - Earlier versions supported aliases ``None``, ``null`` and the
          empty string for selecting the main window, and alias ``self``
          for selecting the current window. These aliases were deprecated
          in SeleniumLibrary 3.0.
        - Prior to SeleniumLibrary 3.0 matching windows by name, title
          and URL was case-insensitive.
