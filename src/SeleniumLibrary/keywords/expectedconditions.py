        """Waits until ``condition`` is true or ``timeout`` expires.

        The condition must be one of selenium's expected condition which
        can be found within the selenium
        [https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_support/selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions.html#module-selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions|Python API]
        documentation. The expected condition can written as snake_case
        (ex title_is) or it can be space delimited (ex Title Is). Some
        conditions require additional arguments or ``args`` which should
        be passed along after the expected condition.

        Fails if the timeout expires before the condition becomes true.
        The default value is 10 seconds.

        Examples:
        | `Wait For Expected Condition` | alert_is_present |
        | `Wait For Expected Condition` |  Title Is  | New Title |

        If the expected condition expects a locator then one can pass
        as arguments a tuple containing the selenium locator strategies
        and the locator.

        Example of expected condition expecting locator:
        | ${byElem}= |  Evaluate  ("id","added_btn")
        | `Wait For Expected Condition` | Presence Of Element Located | ${byElem}
