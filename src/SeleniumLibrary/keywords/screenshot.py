        set when `importing` the library or by using the `Set Screenshot
        Directory` keyword. If the directory is not configured, screenshots
        are saved to the same directory where Robot Framework's log file is
        written.

        Starting from SeleniumLibrary 1.8, if ``filename`` contains marker
        ``{index}``, it will be automatically replaced with unique running
        index preventing files to be overwritten. Indices start from 1,
        and how they are represented can be customized using Python's
        [https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings|
        format string syntax].

        An absolute path to the created screenshot file is returned.
