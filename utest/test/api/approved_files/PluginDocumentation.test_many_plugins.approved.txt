SeleniumLibrary is a web testing library for Robot Framework.

This document explains how to use keywords provided by SeleniumLibrary.
For information about installation, support, and more, please visit the

SeleniumLibrary uses the Selenium WebDriver modules internally to
control a web browser. See http://seleniumhq.org for more information
about Selenium in general and SeleniumLibrary README.rst
[https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary#browser-drivers|Browser drivers chapter]
for more details about WebDriver binary installation.

= Locating elements =

All keywords in SeleniumLibrary that need to interact with an element
on a web page take an argument typically named ``locator`` that specifies
how to find the element. Most often the locator is given as a string
using the locator syntax described below, but `using WebElements` is
possible too.

== Locator syntax ==

SeleniumLibrary supports finding elements based on different strategies
such as the element id, XPath expressions, or CSS selectors. The strategy
can either be explicitly specified with a prefix or the strategy can be
implicit.

=== Default locator strategy ===

By default, locators are considered to use the keyword specific default
locator strategy. All keywords support finding elements based on ``id``
and ``name`` attributes, but some keywords support additional attributes
or other values that make sense in their context. For example, `Click
Link` supports the ``href`` attribute and the link text and addition
to the normal ``id`` and ``name``.

Examples:

| `Click Element` | example | # Match based on ``id`` or ``name``.            |
| `Click Link`    | example | # Match also based on link text and ``href``.   |
| `Click Button`  | example | # Match based on ``id``, ``name`` or ``value``. |

If a locator accidentally starts with a prefix recognized as `explicit
locator strategy` or `implicit XPath strategy`, it is possible to use
the explicit ``default`` prefix to enable the default strategy.

Examples:

| `Click Element` | name:foo         | # Find element with name ``foo``.               |
| `Click Element` | default:name:foo | # Use default strategy with value ``name:foo``. |
| `Click Element` | //foo            | # Find element using XPath ``//foo``.           |
| `Click Element` | default: //foo   | # Use default strategy with value ``//foo``.    |

=== Explicit locator strategy ===

The explicit locator strategy is specified with a prefix using either
syntax ``strategy:value`` or ``strategy=value``. The former syntax
is preferred because the latter is identical to Robot Framework's
[http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#named-argument-syntax|
named argument syntax] and that can cause problems. Spaces around
the separator are ignored, so ``id:foo``, ``id: foo`` and ``id : foo``
are all equivalent.

Locator strategies that are supported by default are listed in the table
below. In addition to them, it is possible to register `custom locators`.

| = Strategy = |          = Match based on =         |         = Example =            |
| id           | Element ``id``.                     | ``id:example``                 |
| name         | ``name`` attribute.                 | ``name:example``               |
| identifier   | Either ``id`` or ``name``.          | ``identifier:example``         |
| class        | Element ``class``.                  | ``class:example``              |
| tag          | Tag name.                           | ``tag:div``                    |
| xpath        | XPath expression.                   | ``xpath://div[@id="example"]`` |
| css          | CSS selector.                       | ``css:div#example``            |
| dom          | DOM expression.                     | ``dom:document.images[5]``     |
| link         | Exact text a link has.              | ``link:The example``           |
| partial link | Partial link text.                  | ``partial link:he ex``         |
| sizzle       | Sizzle selector deprecated.         | ``sizzle:div.example``         |
| data         | Element ``data-*`` attribute        | ``data:id:my_id``              |
| jquery       | jQuery expression.                  | ``jquery:div.example``         |
| default      | Keyword specific default behavior.  | ``default:example``            |

See the `Default locator strategy` section below for more information
about how the default strategy works. Using the explicit ``default``
prefix is only necessary if the locator value itself accidentally
matches some of the explicit strategies.

Different locator strategies have different pros and cons. Using ids,
either explicitly like ``id:foo`` or by using the `default locator
strategy` simply like ``foo``, is recommended when possible, because
the syntax is simple and locating elements by id is fast for browsers.
If an element does not have an id or the id is not stable, other
solutions need to be used. If an element has a unique tag name or class,
using ``tag``, ``class`` or ``css`` strategy like ``tag:h1``,
``class:example`` or ``css:h1.example`` is often an easy solution. In
more complex cases using XPath expressions is typically the best
approach. They are very powerful but a downside is that they can also
get complex.

Examples:

| `Click Element` | id:foo                      | # Element with id 'foo'. |
| `Click Element` | css:div#foo h1              | # h1 element under div with id 'foo'. |
| `Click Element` | xpath: //div[@id="foo"]//h1 | # Same as the above using XPath, not CSS. |
| `Click Element` | xpath: //*[contains(text(), "example")] | # Element containing text 'example'. |

*NOTE:*

- The ``strategy:value`` syntax is only supported by SeleniumLibrary 3.0
  and newer.
- Using the ``sizzle`` strategy or its alias ``jquery`` requires that
  the system under test contains the jQuery library.
- Prior to SeleniumLibrary 3.0, table related keywords only supported
  ``xpath``, ``css`` and ``sizzle/jquery`` strategies.
- ``data`` strategy is conveniance locator that will construct xpath from the parameters.
  If you have element like `<div data-automation="automation-id-2">`, you locate the element via
  ``data:automation:automation-id-2``. This feature was added in SeleniumLibrary 5.2.0

=== Implicit XPath strategy ===

If the locator starts with ``//``  or multiple opening parenthesis in front
of the ``//``, the locator is considered to be an XPath expression. In other
words, using ``//div`` is equivalent to using explicit ``xpath://div`` and
``((//div))`` is equivalent to using explicit ``xpath:((//div))``

Examples:

| `Click Element` | //div[@id="foo"]//h1 |
| `Click Element` | (//div)[2]           |

The support for the ``(//`` prefix is new in SeleniumLibrary 3.0.
Supporting multiple opening parenthesis is new in SeleniumLibrary 5.0.

=== Chaining locators ===

It is possible chain multiple locators together as single locator. Each chained locator must start with locator
strategy. Chained locators must be separated with single space, two greater than characters and followed with
space. It is also possible mix different locator strategies, example css or xpath. Also a list can also be
used to specify multiple locators. This is useful, is some part of locator would match as the locator separator
but it should not. Or if there is need to existing WebElement as locator.

Although all locators support chaining, some locator strategies do not abey the chaining. This is because
some locator strategies use JavaScript to find elements and JavaScript is executed for the whole browser context
and not for the element found be the previous locator. Chaining is supported by locator strategies which
are based on Selenium API, like `xpath` or `css`, but example chaining is not supported by `sizzle` or `jquery

Examples:
| `Click Element` | css:.bar >> xpath://a | # To find a link which is present after an element with class "bar" |

List examples:
| ${locator_list} =             | `Create List`   | css:div#div_id            | xpath://*[text(), " >> "] |
| `Page Should Contain Element` | ${locator_list} |                           |                           |
| ${element} =                  | Get WebElement  | xpath://*[text(), " >> "] |                           |
| ${locator_list} =             | `Create List`   | css:div#div_id            | ${element}                |
| `Page Should Contain Element` | ${locator_list} |                           |                           |

Chaining locators in new in SeleniumLibrary 5.0

== Using WebElements ==

In addition to specifying a locator as a string, it is possible to use
Selenium's WebElement objects. This requires first getting a WebElement,
for example, by using the `Get WebElement` keyword.

| ${elem} =       | `Get WebElement` | id:example |
| `Click Element` | ${elem}          |            |

== Custom locators ==

If more complex lookups are required than what is provided through the
default locators, custom lookup strategies can be created. Using custom
locators is a two part process. First, create a keyword that returns
a WebElement that should be acted on:

| Custom Locator Strategy | [Arguments] | ${browser} | ${locator} | ${tag} | ${constraints} |
|   | ${element}= | Execute Javascript | return window.document.getElementById('${locator}'); |
|   | [Return] | ${element} |

This keyword is a reimplementation of the basic functionality of the
``id`` locator where ``${browser}`` is a reference to a WebDriver
instance and ``${locator}`` is the name of the locator strategy. To use
this locator, it must first be registered by using the
`Add Location Strategy` keyword:

| `Add Location Strategy` | custom | Custom Locator Strategy |

The first argument of `Add Location Strategy` specifies the name of
the strategy and it must be unique. After registering the strategy,
the usage is the same as with other locators:

| `Click Element` | custom:example |

See the `Add Location Strategy` keyword for more details.

= Browser and Window =

There is different conceptual meaning when SeleniumLibrary talks
about windows or browsers. This chapter explains those differences.

== Browser ==

When `Open Browser` or `Create WebDriver` keyword is called, it
will create a new Selenium WebDriver instance by using the
[https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp|Selenium WebDriver]
API. In SeleniumLibrary terms, a new browser is created. It is
possible to start multiple independent browsers (Selenium Webdriver
instances) at the same time, by calling `Open Browser` or
`Create WebDriver` multiple times. These browsers are usually
independent of each other and do not share data like cookies,
sessions or profiles. Typically when the browser starts, it
creates a single window which is shown to the user.

== Window ==

Windows are the part of a browser that loads the web site and presents
it to the user. All content of the site is the content of the window.
Windows are children of a browser. In SeleniumLibrary browser is a
synonym for WebDriver instance. One browser may have multiple
windows. Windows can appear as tabs, as separate windows or pop-ups with
different position and size. Windows belonging to the same browser
typically share the sessions detail, like cookies. If there is a
need to separate sessions detail, example login with two different
users, two browsers (Selenium WebDriver instances) must be created.
New windows can be opened example by the application under test or
by example `Execute Javascript` keyword:

| `Execute Javascript`    window.open()    # Opens a new window with location about:blank

The example below opens multiple browsers and windows,
to demonstrate how the different keywords can be used to interact
with browsers, and windows attached to these browsers.

Structure:
| BrowserA
|            Window 1  (location=https://robotframework.org/)
|            Window 2  (location=https://robocon.io/)
|            Window 3  (location=https://github.com/robotframework/)
|
| BrowserB
|            Window 1  (location=https://github.com/)

Example:
| `Open Browser`       | https://robotframework.org         | ${BROWSER}       | alias=BrowserA   | # BrowserA with first window is opened.                                       |
| `Execute Javascript` | window.open()                      |                  |                  | # In BrowserA second window is opened.                                        |
| `Switch Window`      | locator=NEW                        |                  |                  | # Switched to second window in BrowserA                                       |
| `Go To`              | https://robocon.io                 |                  |                  | # Second window navigates to robocon site.                                    |
| `Execute Javascript` | window.open()                      |                  |                  | # In BrowserA third window is opened.                                         |
| ${handle}            | `Switch Window`                    | locator=NEW      |                  | # Switched to third window in BrowserA                                        |
| `Go To`              | https://github.com/robotframework/ |                  |                  | # Third windows goes to robot framework github site.                          |
| `Open Browser`       | https://github.com                 | ${BROWSER}       | alias=BrowserB   | # BrowserB with first windows is opened.                                      |
| ${location}          | `Get Location`                     |                  |                  | # ${location} is: https://www.github.com                                      |
| `Switch Window`      | ${handle}                          | browser=BrowserA |                  | # BrowserA second windows is selected.                                        |
| ${location}          | `Get Location`                     |                  |                  | # ${location} = https://robocon.io/                                           |
| @{locations 1}       | `Get Locations`                    |                  |                  | # By default, lists locations under the currectly active browser (BrowserA).   |
| @{locations 2}       | `Get Locations`                    |  browser=ALL     |                  | # By using browser=ALL argument keyword list all locations from all browsers. |

The above example, @{locations 1} contains the following items:
https://robotframework.org/, https://robocon.io/ and
https://github.com/robotframework/'. The @{locations 2}
contains the following items: https://robotframework.org/,
https://robocon.io/, https://github.com/robotframework/'
and 'https://github.com/.

= Browser and Driver options and service class =

This section talks about how to configure either the browser or
the driver using the options and service arguments of the `Open
Browser` keyword.

== Configuring the browser using the Selenium Options ==

As noted within the keyword documentation for `Open Browser`, its
``options`` argument accepts Selenium options in two different
formats: as a string and as Python object which is an instance of
the Selenium options class.

=== Options string format ===

The string format allows defining Selenium options methods
or attributes and their arguments in Robot Framework test data.
The method and attributes names are case and space sensitive and
must match to the Selenium options methods and attributes names.
When defining a method, it must be defined in a similar way as in
python: method name, opening parenthesis, zero to many arguments
and closing parenthesis. If there is a need to define multiple
arguments for a single method, arguments must be separated with
comma, just like in Python. Example: `add_argument("--headless")`
or `add_experimental_option("key", "value")`. Attributes are
defined in a similar way as in Python: attribute name, equal sign,
and attribute value. Example, `headless=True`. Multiple methods
and attributes must be separated by a semicolon. Example:
`add_argument("--headless");add_argument("--start-maximized")`.

Arguments allow defining Python data types and arguments are
evaluated by using Python
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval|ast.literal_eval].
Strings must be quoted with single or double quotes, example "value"
or 'value'. It is also possible to define other Python builtin
data types, example `True` or `None`, by not using quotes
around the arguments.

The string format is space friendly. Usually, spaces do not alter
the defining methods or attributes. There are two exceptions.
In some Robot Framework test data formats, two or more spaces are
considered as cell separator and instead of defining a single
argument, two or more arguments may be defined. Spaces in string
arguments are not removed and are left as is. Example
`add_argument ( "--headless" )` is same as
`add_argument("--headless")`. But `add_argument(" --headless ")` is
not same same as `add_argument ( "--headless" )`, because
spaces inside of quotes are not removed. Please note that if
options string contains backslash, example a Windows OS path,
the backslash needs escaping both in Robot Framework data and
in Python side. This means single backslash must be writen using
four backslash characters. Example, Windows path:
"C:\path\to\profile" must be written as
"C:\\\\path\\\to\\\\profile". Another way to write
backslash is use Python
[https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals|raw strings]
and example write: r"C:\\path\\to\\profile".

=== Selenium Options as Python class ===

As last format, ``options`` argument also supports receiving
the Selenium options as Python class instance. In this case, the
instance is used as-is and the SeleniumLibrary will not convert
the instance to other formats.
For example, if the following code return value is saved to
`${options}` variable in the Robot Framework data:
| options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
| options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')
| return options

Then the `${options}` variable can be used as an argument to
``options``.

Example the ``options`` argument can be used to launch Chomium-based
applications which utilize the
[https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/UsingChromeDriver|Chromium Embedded Framework]
. To launch Chromium-based application, use ``options`` to define
`binary_location` attribute and use `add_argument` method to define
`remote-debugging-port` port for the application. Once the browser
is opened, the test can interact with the embedded web-content of
the system under test.

== Configuring the driver using the Service class ==

With the ``service`` argument, one can setup and configure the driver. For example
one can set the driver location and/port or specify the command line arguments. There
are several browser specific attributes related to logging as well. For the various
Service Class attributes refer to
[https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/drivers/service/|the Selenium documentation]
. Currently the ``service`` argument only accepts Selenium service in the string format.

=== Service string format ===

The string format allows for defining Selenium service attributes
and their values in the `Open Browser` keyword. The attributes names
are case and space sensitive and must match to the Selenium attributes
names. Attributes are defined in a similar way as in Python: attribute
name, equal sign, and attribute value. Example, `port=1234`. Multiple
attributes must be separated by a semicolon. Example:
`executable_path='/path/to/driver';port=1234`. Don't have duplicate
attributes, like `service_args=['--append-log', '--readable-timestamp'];
service_args=['--log-level=DEBUG']` as the second will override the first.
Instead combine them as in
`service_args=['--append-log', '--readable-timestamp', '--log-level=DEBUG']`

Arguments allow defining Python data types and arguments are
evaluated by using Python. Strings must be quoted with single
or double quotes, example "value" or 'value'

= Timeouts, waits, and delays =

This section discusses different ways how to wait for elements to
appear on web pages and to slow down execution speed otherwise.
It also explains the `time format` that can be used when setting various
timeouts, waits, and delays.

== Timeout ==

SeleniumLibrary contains various keywords that have an optional
``timeout`` argument that specifies how long these keywords should
wait for certain events or actions. These keywords include, for example,
``Wait ...`` keywords and keywords related to alerts. Additionally
`Execute Async Javascript`. Although it does not have ``timeout``,
argument, uses a timeout to define how long asynchronous JavaScript
can run.

The default timeout these keywords use can be set globally either by
using the `Set Selenium Timeout` keyword or with the ``timeout`` argument
when `importing` the library. If no default timeout is set globally, the
default is 5 seconds. If None is specified for the timeout argument in the
keywords, the default is used. See `time format` below for supported
timeout syntax.

== Implicit wait ==

Implicit wait specifies the maximum time how long Selenium waits when
searching for elements. It can be set by using the `Set Selenium Implicit
Wait` keyword or with the ``implicit_wait`` argument when `importing`
the library. See [https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp|
Selenium documentation] for more information about this functionality.

See `time format` below for supported syntax.

== Page load ==
Page load timeout is the amount of time to wait for page load to complete
until a timeout exception is raised.

The default page load timeout can be set globally
when `importing` the library with the ``page_load_timeout`` argument
or by using the `Set Selenium Page Load Timeout` keyword.

See `time format` below for supported timeout syntax.

Support for page load is new in SeleniumLibrary 6.1

== Selenium speed ==

Selenium execution speed can be slowed down globally by using `Set
Selenium speed` keyword. This functionality is designed to be used for
demonstrating or debugging purposes. Using it to make sure that elements
appear on a page is not a good idea. The above-explained timeouts
and waits should be used instead.

See `time format` below for supported syntax.

== Time format ==

All timeouts and waits can be given as numbers considered seconds
(e.g. ``0.5`` or ``42``) or in Robot Framework's time syntax
(e.g. ``1.5 seconds`` or ``1 min 30 s``). For more information about
the time syntax see the
[http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#time-format|Robot Framework User Guide].

= Run-on-failure functionality =

SeleniumLibrary has a handy feature that it can automatically execute
a keyword if any of its own keywords fails. By default, it uses the
`Capture Page Screenshot` keyword, but this can be changed either by
using the `Register Keyword To Run On Failure` keyword or with the
``run_on_failure`` argument when `importing` the library. It is
possible to use any keyword from any imported library or resource file.

The run-on-failure functionality can be disabled by using a special value
``NOTHING`` or anything considered false (see `Boolean arguments`)
such as ``NONE``.

= Boolean arguments =

Starting from 5.0 SeleniumLibrary relies on Robot Framework to perform the
boolean conversion based on keyword arguments [https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html|type hint].
More details in Robot Framework
[http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#supported-conversions|user guide]

Please note SeleniumLibrary 3 and 4 did have own custom methods to covert
arguments to boolean values.

= EventFiringWebDriver =

The SeleniumLibrary offers support for
[https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_support/selenium.webdriver.support.event_firing_webdriver.html#module-selenium.webdriver.support.event_firing_webdriver|EventFiringWebDriver].
See the Selenium and SeleniumLibrary
[https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary/blob/master/docs/extending/extending.rst#EventFiringWebDriver|EventFiringWebDriver support]
documentation for further details.

EventFiringWebDriver is new in SeleniumLibrary 4.0

= Thread support =

SeleniumLibrary is not thread-safe. This is mainly due because the underlying
[https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#q-is-webdriver-thread-safe|
Selenium tool is not thread-safe] within one browser/driver instance.
Because of the limitation in the Selenium side, the keywords or the
API provided by the SeleniumLibrary is not thread-safe.

= Plugins =

SeleniumLibrary offers plugins as a way to modify and add library keywords and modify some of the internal
functionality without creating a new library or hacking the source code. See
[https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary/blob/master/docs/extending/extending.rst#Plugins|plugin API]
documentation for further details.

Plugin API is new SeleniumLibrary 4.0

= Plugin: my_lib =
