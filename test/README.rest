Selenium2Library Tests
======================


Introduction
------------

This directory contains everything needed to run Selenium2Library 
tests with Robot Framework. This includes:

- Unit tests under `unit` directory.
- Acceptance tests written with Robot Framework under `acceptance` 
  directory
- A very simple httpserver.py which is used to serve the html for tests in
  `resources/testserver`
- A collection of simple html files under 'resources/html' directory
- Start-up scripts for executing the tests


Running Tests
-------------

There is a python script for running the tests. It can be
used as follows::

	python run_tests.py python|jython ff|ie|chrome [options]

The first argument to the script defines the interpreter to be used
to run Robot. The second argument defines the browser to be used,
using the same browser tokens that you would use in your Robot
tests.

Due to the structure of the tests, the directory containg the test
case files (`acceptance`) is always given to Robot as test data path.
To run only a subset of test cases, Robot command line arguments
--test, --suite, --include and --exclude may be used.

Examples::

  # Run all tests with Python and Firefox
  test/run_tests.py python ff
  # Run only test suite `javascript` with Jython and Internet Explorer
  test/run_tests.py jython ie -s javascript


Failing Tests
-------------

When the tests are executed, a number of test cases can be seen to
fail in the console output.  This is because these test cases are
designed to test error messages of Selenium2Library. The script
'teststatuschecker.py' is used to check that these test cases failed
with expected error message. After that, report and log files are
generated and these files show the correct status of the test run.
