# For issues
## Steps to reproduce the issue

Create a simplified example which reproduces the problem. It is good if the example
can be run also by us, but this is not always mandatory.

## Error messages and additional information

If there is an error, run the test with `--loglevel trace` set from command line
and copy paste the full stack trace to the issue. Use https://gist.github.com/ or
similar service for anything that longer than few lines.

Provide other details which might be useful for investigating the issue. Screenshots
from application or from unexpected dialogues are example useful. Sometimes showing
relevant parts of the log.html is useful too.

# Feature requests
Describe the need or the feature you are missing from the SeleniumLibrary. Also it
is useful to understand why you need such feature. Many times, it is useful to provide
few examples for acceptance tests. Try to avoid technical or implementation details,
those will handled later.

This project is not funded by any organisation or company, I do this because I
want to do this on my own free time. Therefore if you want feature be implemented,
the easiest and usually fastest way usually is to provide pull request. See
https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst
for mode details about project development.
