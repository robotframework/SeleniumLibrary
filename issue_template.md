# Prerequisites

- I have searched for similar issues in both open tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
- The issue still exists against the latest released of SeleniumLibrary.
- This is not a usage question or support request. Those those see more details in [README](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary#support).

# Steps to reproduce the issue
Create a simplified example which reproduces the problem. It is good if the example
can be run also by us, but this is not always mandatory.

## Error messages and additional information
If there is an error, run the test with `--loglevel trace` set from command line
paste the full stack trace.

Consider using [Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
